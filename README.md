## FTC TFoD Easy

### Credits:
Credits to [ssysm](github.com/ssysm) for creating some of the original framework

***
### Preface:
This framework is designed so teams are able to train fully fledged tensorflow models on local machines instead of using FIRST's ftcml in the cloud. This is only helpful if a member has a powerful enough pc with a GPU. Otherwise I recommend that you use ftcml instead. This program has been updated to make the user experience much better. With that said, it still will require atleast some technical know-how as problems will arise.
